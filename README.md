# 3D-Geometric-Features
Implementations of 3D geometric features for geometry processing. 
Using Qt 5+ and Starlab[https://github.com/ennetws/starlab]

Feature list: 
*Average Geodesic distance 
*Biharmonic Distance 
*Shape Diameter Function 
*Concavity 
*Conformal Factor 
*Curvature 
*PCA Shape Estimation 
*Symmetry Detection

Multiple fundalmental geometric tools has been included in /ddtt
